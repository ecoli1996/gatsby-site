It's unique since you get to run on the beach the whole time. You get some good swag. The after party is in too small of an area, but it's still fun to check out for a bit and enjoy some live music. I would probably skip the free food honestly and just grab something on my own. Make sure to carpool and hydrate because the salty air will dry out your mouth, but in my opinion it's worth it for the great cause and the fun atmosphere.\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","excerpt":"Summary This race report is for the Turtle Trek  5K , which takes place in  Isle of Palms, SC , and benefits the South Carolina Aqaurium's…","timeToRead":2,"banner":null}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/race-reports/turtle-trek","formatString":"DD.MM.YYYY"}}
