Each tech company has a theme, like one year we did Nintendo, and they have shirts to reflect that.

So, I can only speak to what I saw on race day. The water station is very light but I didn't hear of anyone not getting water. The after party is awesome so that's really well organized. The only thing I don't like is that the lines for pizzas and beer get very long because there are so many racers. Also, they don't limit the number of pizzas and beer so if you finish later, you might not get any. Like someone else mentioned too there are people who bib swap because it's not a serious race and because it's on a weekday with employees from the tech companies, they may end up having a problem at work or a last minute meeting pop up and give it to a coworker.
