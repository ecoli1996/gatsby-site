I have to say this was the most difficult hike we did our entire trip, albeit gorgeous.\nMy boyfriend is afraid of heights and he mentally struggled with one particular part toward the end. I think you can do this hike even if you're afraid of heights, but as soon as it looks scary, just turn around.\nThe difficulty only increases. But please don't let that scare you! It's so worth it, and if you are too scared, at least do the super easy Blueberry Loop, admire the beautiful flowers, and pick some berries!`}</p>\n    <h5>{`Anchorage to Seward`}</h5>\n    <p>\n      <FontAwesomeIcon icon={['fas', 'tag']} size=\"lg\" mdxType=\"FontAwesomeIcon\" />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time we got back downtown from Flattop, it was time to take the bus back to the airport and pick up our rental car!
