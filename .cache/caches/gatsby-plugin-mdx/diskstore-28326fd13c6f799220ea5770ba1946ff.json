I had never done one before and thought it was cool that it had short distance options. Everyone was super friendly and the course is fun and non-intimidating. It's also great if you're looking to get an age group prize for the 5K. The 10K has a lot faster people.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`T-Shirts/SWAG`}</h3>\n    <p><span parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\",\n        \"style\": {\n          \"position\": \"relative\",\n          \"display\": \"block\",\n          \"marginLeft\": \"auto\",\n          \"marginRight\": \"auto\",\n          \"maxWidth\": \"375px\"\n        }\n      }}>{`\n      `}<span parentName=\"span\" {...{\n          \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\",\n          \"style\": {\n            \"paddingBottom\": \"133.33333333333331%\",\n            \"position\": \"relative\",\n            \"bottom\": \"0\",\n            \"left\": \"0\",\n            \"backgroundImage\": \"url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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')\",\n            \"backgroundSize\": \"cover\",\n            \"display\": \"block\"\n          }\n        }}></span>{`\n  `}<img parentName=\"span\" {...{\n          \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-image\",\n          \"alt\": \"A dark blue tech-shirt with Mullet Haul written in bright lime green.\",\n          \"title\": \"A dark blue tech-shirt with Mullet Haul written in bright lime green.\",\n          \"src\": \"/static/4c9c0bb5bca4bb79e57966e8f989cec2/f21ed/mullethaulshirt.jpg\",\n          \"srcSet\": [\"/static/4c9c0bb5bca4bb79e57966e8f989cec2/46946/mullethaulshirt.jpg 240w\", \"/static/4c9c0bb5bca4bb79e57966e8f989cec2/f21ed/mullethaulshirt.jpg 375w\"],\n          \"sizes\": \"(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px\",\n          \"style\": {\n            \"width\": \"100%\",\n            \"height\": \"100%\",\n            \"margin\": \"0\",\n            \"verticalAlign\": \"middle\",\n            \"position\": \"absolute\",\n            \"top\": \"0\",\n            \"left\": \"0\"\n          },\n          \"loading\": \"lazy\"\n        }}></img>{`\n    `}</span>{`\nNot much in the form of SWAG but the material of the T-Shirt is awesome! I included it in a picture. My boyfriend won an age group prize, but never picked it up but I think the prizes were actually cool pint glasses.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Aid Stations`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Like most 5Ks, there's one water station at halfway and some cheering fans volunteering. There were more than enough drinks and snacks at the end of the race and because of the area there are lots of picnic benches and area to spread out. They also had a PT station helping people do post race stretches!`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Course Scenery`}</h3>\n    <p>{`The trail doesn't have much scenery. Mostly trees and since it's a horse trail, there's some poop you have to watch out for, but you'll smell it before you step in it haha. It's nicely shaded most of the time until the end where you run through a big field.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Expo Quality`}</h3>\n    <p>{`There wasn't an expo before but there were actually some vendors at the race you could talk to which I thought was cool for a small local race.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Elevation Difficulty`}</h3>\n    <p>{`It is flat but it's different terrain if you're used to a road race. I used road shoes and was fine and actually liked the spongey feel of an almost sawdust like terrain. The end though has you running through a big grass field and that was kinda hard to be honest.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Parking/Access`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Plenty of parking and close to the start line. We were running late because my boyfriend plugged in the wrong address the night before so we thought we had more time. 5 minutes to start, we parked, grabbed our bibs, and walked to the finish line with time to spare.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Race Management`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Everything ran smoothly on race day. Like I mentioned in Parking, we were late and our bibs were given to us quickly and we were signed in very quickly as well. They even held our shirts for us so we could pick them up after. The people checking us in were very nice and joked with us about our lack of punctuality. They were great! The trail was also clearly marked and there were enough volunteers helping to make sure you were going the right way. I almost went the 10K route and a volunteer was quick to make sure I didn't subject myself to that.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Conclusion`}</h3>\n    <p>{`I would definitely recommend this race to a friend, especially one that is looking for more trail runs in the Charleston area. It's low key without a ton of people but enough energy to have a great time. Despite not a big race, I felt cheered on by volunteers and fellow runners. It's also very shaded on the trail, which is greatly appreciated in Charleston. I think more people sign up for the 10K, so if you're doing the 5K, you have a pretty good chance of placing in your age group. I will definitely sign up again :) and hopefully be on time...`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
