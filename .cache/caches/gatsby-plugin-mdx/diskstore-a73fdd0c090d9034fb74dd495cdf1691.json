Because it was both a 5K and a 10K, you not only got your 10K water stations, but the 5K water stations as well. I never felt dehydrated! The volunteers were great too.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Course Scenery`}</h3>\n    <p>{`IOP is beautiful and you get to see the beautiful creeks the connector goes over. It is still a bridge run though so it isn't like there's a ton of variety.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Expo Quality`}</h3>\n    <p>{`No expo, but there were some vendors at the finish area. There is also bib pickup ahead of time as well as day-of-race.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Elevation Difficulty`}</h3>\n    <p>{`It is a bridge run so there are some hills but I want to say there's no more than 4 and they aren't that bad! I'm a huge baby when it comes to any kind of elevation since I've only lived in flat areas, so if I think it's not too bad, you probably won't either. Still, it's enough of a challenge to make you feel accomplished.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Parking/Access`}</h3>\n    <p>{`We had no problems parking as parking was communicated very clearly. It wasn't too far from the start either.\nBecause it was so early too, the lot was pretty much exclusively runners. `}</p>\n    <h3>{`Race Management`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Overall, it was well-managed. There were lots of portapotties and the ability to pickup your bib and swag ahead of time. There were ample aid stations and a great after party with music, some food, and unlimited beer. The instructions on how to get there and what time the connector would close down was communicated very well too. The only thing that wasn't communicated well was the food situation.\nIt was said there would be free sausage after the race but it was really the local fire station volunteering to grill some small bites, so I was expecting a big brat instead of a small piece of sausage. It was incredibly kind of them to do that though!! Otherwise, there were bagels and bananas you could snack on. I just wish they didn't make it seem like you were getting a free meal afterward.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Conclusion`}</h3>\n    <p>{`I would definitley recommend this race especially if you don't normally get to do hill training. It can be hard to fit elevation into your training in Charleston and this is a great way to do just that without crushing your legs. The amount of aid stations and awesome volunteers makes it a very pleasant run as well. It's also for a great cause.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
