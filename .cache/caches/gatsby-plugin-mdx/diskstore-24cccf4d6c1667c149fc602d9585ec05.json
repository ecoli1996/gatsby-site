I mean what better way to celebrate your first race\nthan to go to Disney World? And, because it's such a big race, there are so many events at the expo to enjoy and lots of on-course volunteers, aid stations, medical staff, etc.\nto help propel you to the finish line. When it came down to it, a part of me thought I may never want to do a half marathon again (LOL), so I might as well go big or go home!\nI say \"LOL\" because I think the whole runDisney atmosphere made me want to do more races.

When I registered for my half, it was about a month later and I don't think it sold out until September. But, with COVID-19 causing runDisney events, as well as most other races, to go virtual, more people will be itching to register.\nAlso, some years they can sell out super fast because it's an anniversary year for the race or people love the theme. Basically, you just never know but it's always best to assume it will sell out, so try to have a browser open on the registration page 5 minutes before registration opens. Don't refresh the page!\nPersonally, I try to have the web page open in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, and Safari) and at least one on my phone. This came in handy registering for the runDisney Virtual Summer Series since I had a data blocker Chrome extension causing some issues on the checkout form, but the other browsers didn't have that extension and therefore didn't have that problem.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><strong parentName=\"li\">{`Paying with a gift card?`}</strong>{` You have to make sure it is all on one gift card AND that it covers the entire fee.

And I think it really comes down to whether or not you have a car.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Since we were able to drive to Disney, it was actually more expensive for us to stay on property because of the daily parking fees. Without a car,\nthis isn't something you have to worry about. Plus, the resorts have buses that take you to the race start. But, from other people's experiences, IF you\nhave a car available, it seems better to take it to the race start rather than use the provided transportation. I even know of some people who will use Uber\nbecause they leave before the buses even do! Gotta get those pre-race character photos!

I believe some of these do actually have transportation to some of the races, but I'm not sure which ones.

You may be super tired after, but you should be finished in time to take a nap and go to the parks.\nFor the half and the full, if this is your first time doing that distance, you should really clock how you feel after your longest run in training.\nMy boyfriend did the marathon and hit the parks right after no problem. My friend and I went to Epcot and Magic Kingdom as soon as we finished the half.\nBut, something you'll learn about running is that everyone is different! `}</p>\n    <p>{`For Goofy and Dopey, I can't even imagine being jazzed enough to hit the parks.

Basically, the race just isn't really timed, so there isn't a cutoff like the other races.`}</p>\n    <p>{`If you look at runDisney's website, it will tell you that you need to maintain a 16:00 minute per mile pace\nfor the 10K, Half, and Full. What it doesn't tell you is that you must maintain a 16:00 minute per mile pace,\nstarting from the last person to cross the start line. So, if you're in an earlier corral, you can take a little bit longer.`}</p>\n    <p>{`To help the racers figure out how they're doing on pace, there are these people called \"The Balloon Ladies.\"\nThese women start right after the last person crosses the start line and maintain that 16:00 min./mile pace\nthe entire race. As long as you stay in front of them, you're golden! They're really nice and sometimes will allow people to share their bib\nnumbers so you can track them during the race. `}</p>\n    <h3>{`What are character stops? Can I stop at all the characters? Should I get Photo Pass?`}</h3>\n    <p>{`\"Character stops\" refer to points along the course where you can take pictures with different Disney characters.\nDuring the half last year I stopped to take pictures with only 2 charcters:`}</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`Goofy who was wearing vacation clothes and in front of a yacht`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`Stitch in his lai`}</li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>{`For reference, I was in corral E. I definitely could've stopped for way more characters. In fact, I regret not stopping for more!\nMy boyfriend did the marathon and was in corral in D. He stopped for so many characters due to the extreme heat and also dealing with an injury.\nHe had a great time and isn't even a Disney fan (Crazy... I know right?!).`}</p>\n    <CharacterStopCarousel mdxType=\"CharacterStopCarousel\" />\n    <p>{`However, the later the corral you are in, the longer these character stop lines get, so you'll have to limit the number. My friend started in H and she didn't stop for any characters since the lines were so long.\nI would say ahead of time, pick out 3 characters where you think, \"okay if I see this character, I'm stopping\" or if you're running with friends, each of you should have a figurative \"emergency character stop card\" that you can\npull out when you see a certain character meaning you all HAVE to stop and take a picture. If you want to be even more conservative, limit yourself to only stopping when you see a character that fits with your costume theme. For\nexample, stopping for the Queen of Hearts or Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum if you're wearing an Alice in Wonderland costume. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Just be mindful of your pace. Wear a GPS watch that tracks your pace if it helps or take the advice from the section prior and try to track the balloon ladies.\nI believe some of them are in the runDisneyRun Facebook group I mentioned and will happily share their bib numbers. Obviously, don't be creepy and seek out the number if they aren't willing to dole out that information themselves.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In regards to PhotoPass, you don't have to get it to get your character photos. You can hand your own phone to a cast member to take the picture.\nThese don't come out as good (see example below), so if you want really nice pictures, get the PhotoPass, especially if you expect to stop for lots of characters.\nIf you see people in bright green tents, those are the race photographers and you can only get the photos they take of you if you have PhotoPass, so keep that in mind.`}</p>\n    <p><span parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\",\n        \"style\": {\n          \"position\": \"relative\",\n          \"display\": \"block\",\n          \"marginLeft\": \"auto\",\n          \"marginRight\": \"auto\",\n          \"maxWidth\": \"400px\"\n        }\n      }}>{`\n      `}<span parentName=\"span\" {...{\n          \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\",\n          \"style\": {\n            \"paddingBottom\": \"100%\",\n            \"position\": \"relative\",\n            \"bottom\": \"0\",\n            \"left\": \"0\",\n            \"backgroundImage\": \"url('data:image/png;base64,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')\",\n            \"backgroundSize\": \"cover\",\n            \"display\": \"block\"\n          }\n        }}></span>{`\n  `}<img parentName=\"span\" {...{\n          \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-image\",\n          \"alt\": \"A blurry photo of me and Stitch\",\n          \"title\": \"A blurry photo of me and Stitch\",\n          \"src\": \"/static/dffd790501c2d943e03e28cd7b681b9d/6a8a8/stitch.png\",\n          \"srcSet\": [\"/static/dffd790501c2d943e03e28cd7b681b9d/5243c/stitch.png 240w\", \"/static/dffd790501c2d943e03e28cd7b681b9d/6a8a8/stitch.png 400w\"],\n          \"sizes\": \"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\",\n          \"style\": {\n            \"width\": \"100%\",\n            \"height\": \"100%\",\n            \"margin\": \"0\",\n            \"verticalAlign\": \"middle\",\n            \"position\": \"absolute\",\n            \"top\": \"0\",\n            \"left\": \"0\"\n          },\n          \"loading\": \"lazy\"\n        }}></img>{`\n    `}</span></p>\n    <h3>{`How do I stay motivated during training?`}</h3>\n    <ol>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`Something that got me pumped for my runDisney race is having a Disney playlist that I would break out during my runs when I was struggling.\nIt helped me visualize the course and convert my pain from running into excitement. `}</li>\n    </ol>\n    <iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/1rogdZEqf2m0xUMvAkbOIK\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\">\n    </iframe>\n    <ol {...{\n      \"start\": 2\n    }}>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">\n        <p parentName=\"li\">{`Speaking of visualizing the course, there are tons of YouTube videos of runDisney race recaps!
