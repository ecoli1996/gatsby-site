Charleston is very flat. We have a couple of other bridge runs like the IOP Connector and the famous Cooper River Bridge Run. This one is way harder in my opinion than both of those. If you are looking for a challenging 10K in the Charleston area, this is your best bet. It's not impossible though! I'm not the best runner by a long shot and I was able to get through it. There's just no shade so bring sunglasses! The sun will be staring at you in the face. The after party makes the challenge soooo worth it. One of my favorite post-race parties.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`T-Shirts/SWAG`}</h3>\n    <p><span parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\",\n        \"style\": {\n          \"position\": \"relative\",\n          \"display\": \"block\",\n          \"marginLeft\": \"auto\",\n          \"marginRight\": \"auto\",\n          \"maxWidth\": \"500px\"\n        }\n      }}>{`\n      `}<span parentName=\"span\" {...{\n          \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\",\n          \"style\": {\n            \"paddingBottom\": \"100%\",\n            \"position\": \"relative\",\n            \"bottom\": \"0\",\n            \"left\": \"0\",\n            \"backgroundImage\": \"url('data:image/png;base64,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')\",\n            \"backgroundSize\": \"cover\",\n            \"display\": \"block\"\n          }\n        }}></span>{`\n  `}<img parentName=\"span\" {...{\n          \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-image\",\n          \"alt\": \"A collage of the swag from the race: the pink medal with runners, one of which has prosthetic legs and the sky blue T-Shirt with the medal image across the chest. \",\n          \"title\": \"A collage of the swag from the race: the pink medal with runners, one of which has prosthetic legs and the sky blue T-Shirt with the medal image across the chest. \",\n          \"src\": \"/static/4be3ac4dfbb5dc8d16ab3e43db86240a/c6e3d/JICSwag.png\",\n          \"srcSet\": [\"/static/4be3ac4dfbb5dc8d16ab3e43db86240a/5243c/JICSwag.png 240w\", \"/static/4be3ac4dfbb5dc8d16ab3e43db86240a/ab158/JICSwag.png 480w\", \"/static/4be3ac4dfbb5dc8d16ab3e43db86240a/c6e3d/JICSwag.png 500w\"],\n          \"sizes\": \"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\",\n          \"style\": {\n            \"width\": \"100%\",\n            \"height\": \"100%\",\n            \"margin\": \"0\",\n            \"verticalAlign\": \"middle\",\n            \"position\": \"absolute\",\n            \"top\": \"0\",\n            \"left\": \"0\"\n          },\n          \"loading\": \"lazy\"\n        }}></img>{`\n    `}</span></p>\n    <p>{`So I didn't like the shirt because it ran too small especially in the armpit area, but I liked the color.
