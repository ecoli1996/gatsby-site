The common area was also super nice!\nThere was free coffee available and the front desk had some supplies and snacks available for purchase. We asked the person at the front desk\nrecommendations for dinner and she suggested Panorama Pizza Pub which was walkable, just across the street from the hostel!`}</p>\n    <h5>{`Dinner`}</h5>\n    <p>{`We took Denali Hostel's suggestion to eat at `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.facebook.com/PanoramaPizza/\"\n      }}>{`Panorama Pizza Pub`}</a>{`,\nand it was great!

This was probably one of my favorite hikes just because\nit was the longest and had the most elevation variation. You get to see 3 different lakes, hence the name.\nWe saw moose tracks too and ran into hikers who saw a moose swimming in one of the lakes. The route definitely felt more enclosed than\nMt.

It was the perfect\nreward! We were silly to think we'd have the energy to do the full 9.5 miles back, but we didn't so we took the free Denali Park Village shuttle\nto the bus depot. Again, you don't have to be a guest to take advantage of the shuttle. `}</p>\n    <h5>{`Sled Dog Demonstration`}</h5>\n    <p>{`We were so pooped after the hike, but still wanted to take advantage of the time we had left in Denali.\nWe made it back to the park just in time to head to one of their free sled dog demonstrations. The bus we took left from the\ninformation center. Before the demonstration, you can pet some of the dogs and wander the grounds. There's even a tiny\n\"museum\" of sorts that tells you about the history between the dogs and Denali. I would say the demonstration was definitely targeted\ntowards kids but the dogs were so cute and with our legs out of commission, it was a perfect thing to do!`}</p>\n    <p><span parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\",\n        \"style\": {\n          \"position\": \"relative\",\n          \"display\": \"block\",\n          \"marginLeft\": \"auto\",\n          \"marginRight\": \"auto\",\n          \"maxWidth\": \"960px\"\n        }\n      }}>{`\n      `}<span parentName=\"span\" {...{\n          \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\",\n          \"style\": {\n            \"paddingBottom\": \"133.33333333333331%\",\n            \"position\": \"relative\",\n            \"bottom\": \"0\",\n            \"left\": \"0\",\n            \"backgroundImage\": \"url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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')\",\n            \"backgroundSize\": \"cover\",\n            \"display\": \"block\"\n          }\n        }}></span>{`\n  `}<img parentName=\"span\" {...{\n          \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-image\",\n          \"alt\": \"The dogs after demonstrating a sled run\",\n          \"title\": \"The dogs after demonstrating a sled run\",\n          \"src\": \"/static/d6d142a06d49463d7bdcad31c8366bf1/18e3b/sled-dog-demo.jpg\",\n          \"srcSet\": [\"/static/d6d142a06d49463d7bdcad31c8366bf1/46946/sled-dog-demo.jpg 240w\", \"/static/d6d142a06d49463d7bdcad31c8366bf1/55489/sled-dog-demo.jpg 480w\", \"/static/d6d142a06d49463d7bdcad31c8366bf1/18e3b/sled-dog-demo.jpg 960w\"],\n          \"sizes\": \"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\",\n          \"style\": {\n            \"width\": \"100%\",\n            \"height\": \"100%\",\n            \"margin\": \"0\",\n            \"verticalAlign\": \"middle\",\n            \"position\": \"absolute\",\n            \"top\": \"0\",\n            \"left\": \"0\"\n          },\n          \"loading\": \"lazy\"\n        }}></img>{`\n    `}</span></p>\n    <h5>{`Dinner and Drinks`}</h5>\n    <p>{`Our hostel-mates in Girdwood told us we had to check out `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.49statebrewing.com/denali\"\n      }}>{`49th State Brewing`}</a>{` while in Denali.\nWe got there by taking the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.dinedenali.com/\"\n      }}>{`Dine Denali Shuttle`}</a>{`, which picks up and drops off at the bus depot.\nI think the shuttle only cost like $5 a person for a day pass.
