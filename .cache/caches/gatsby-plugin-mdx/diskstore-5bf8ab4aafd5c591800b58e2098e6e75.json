Now, I dropped my boyfriend off at the marathon and that was a different story. We left even earlier that morning to get to the full and he was almost late.\nIn fact they had to push the start time back because so many people were late. That could've been better accounted for I think.\nWith that, I will say if you know you are bad with direction like my boyfriend and I, ask a volunteer for help at the expo! I'm sure they would've been more than happy to help :)`}</p>\n    <p>{`I also heard horror stories about people who took the provided transportation getting dropped off at the wrong resort after the race, bus drivers getting lost on the way to the race, and getting yelled at by said drivers.\nIt's important to note that `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`these are not Disney employees but I believe they are transportation companies hired specifically for this event.`}</strong>{`\nAs far as I know those who contacted runDisney customer services about these incidents were greeted with lots of professionalism and swift action, which is good.\nThis was also the experience of a handful of people so I don't think it's the norm.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Besides all that, I wish the race had more social media engagement. I felt like everything was communicated effectively via email, but it would be nice to have more engagement leading up to the race.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Conclusion`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Overall, as big Disney fan I would recommend this race. You get to run through the castle and meet rare characters and be in a big space of supportive runers who also LOVE Disney :)\nIf that's not your thing, probably not worth the price, but if you are on the fence, get a group together, come up with a fun costume and just have fun with it!\nIt's a great race for that and if you are a beginning runner like myself, it will get you hooked on running!`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
