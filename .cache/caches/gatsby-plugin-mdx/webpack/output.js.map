 because Gatsby requires version of react that has implementatoin baked in.\n  \n  Package source is using ES modules:\n    - https://github.com/jamiebuilds/create-react-context/blob/v0.3.0/src/index.js\n  \n  But to build this package `babel-plugin-add-module-exports` is used ( https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-add-module-exports).\n  Which result in both `module.exports` and `exports.default` being set to same thing.\n\n  We don't use that babel plugin so we only have `exports.default`.\n\n  This cause problems in various 3rd party react components that rely on `module.exports` being set.\n  See https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/23645 for example of it.\n  \n  Instead of adding same babel plugin we mimic output here. Adding babel plugin just for this would:\n   a) unnecesairly slow down compilation for all other files (if we just apply it everywhere)\n   b) or complicate babel-loader configuration with overwrite specifically for this file\n*/\n\nconst { createContext } = require(`react`)\n\nmodule.exports = createContext\nmodule.exports.default = createContext\n","import React from \"react\"\nimport Carousel
