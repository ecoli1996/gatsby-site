It's also pretty early on a weekend so there weren't many cars anyway. The course was clearly marked and even then there were volunteers to direct you. The snacks and beer you get afterwards are amazing! Some of the best I've had at a race.

The 5K sold out pretty fast but there were still some 15K spots open a few weeks before. It is the perfect distance with a fun after party area. The course is flat so perfect for a PR or hitting that distance for the first time. The race has a great sense of community around it too, and I felt encouraged by fellow runners and volunteers along the way.
