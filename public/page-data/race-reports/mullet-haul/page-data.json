It's also very shaded on the trail, which is greatly appreciated in Charleston. I think more people sign up for the 10K, so if you're doing the 5K, you have a pretty good chance of placing in your age group. I will definitely sign up again :) and hopefully be on time...\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","excerpt":"Summary The Mullet Haul Trail Run is a  10K race with a 5K option  that takes place in  John's Island, SC.  \nI could be wrong but I believeâ€¦","timeToRead":3,"banner":null}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/race-reports/mullet-haul","formatString":"DD.MM.YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3090400250","3090400250","318001574"]}
