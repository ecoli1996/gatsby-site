Hi!

Elaina here! For more about me and what this website is about, [please visit the homepage](https://arrayoflight.gatsbyjs.io/).
This about section is more about how I built this site. 

### So how did I do that?

I'm using GatsbyJS to build this site, which is a
React-based, GraphQL powered, static site generator. For this site I started with @lekoart's minimal blog theme and went from there. 

I had never used React or GraphQL before making this website so it's been fun to pick up some new skills.

Some other reasons I chose Gatsby besides learning new things and its easy-to-customize themes are:

1. It's fast! Gatsby automates things like code splitting, image optimization, inlining critical styles, lazy-loading, and prefetching resources
2. Security! According to their website, "Gatsbyâ€™s serverless rendering generates static HTML at build time." No server + no database means, "no malicious requests, DDOS attacks, or accidental exposure."
3. Accessibility! WebAIM (Web Accessibility in Mind) recognized Gatsby as the most accessible web framework.

I can't wait to learn more as I build out this site! Thanks :)
