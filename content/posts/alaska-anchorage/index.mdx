##### Lunch

After landing in Anchorage, I realized I made a mistake on the itinerary and accidentally booked our car rental way later that day.
After recovering from my mini-freakout, Eric and I headed to the information desk at the airport to figure out what we could do in the meantime.
The person at the info desk was super helpful. He let us know we could store our luggage at the airport for super cheap while we went exploring.
Then, he recommended a place called [Humpy's](https://www.humpysalaska.com/) for lunch and a [hike at Flattop Mountain with transportation provided.](http://www.hike-anchorage-alaska.com/Schedule)

Luckily, the bus from the airport has a stop just a block from Humpy's. We had some delicious fish and chips and burgers!
Everyone here was super friendly and the food hit the spot.

##### Flattop Mountain
Unfortunately, it seemed like we wouldn't make the [Flattop Shuttle]((http://www.hike-anchorage-alaska.com/Schedule)) in time,
so we called them asking if they could wait for us. Turns out, we saved the day! In order for the shuttle to leave, they need a minimum
number of passengers and they needed exactly 2 more people in this case. Lucky us! Turns out we could have our Humpy's and eat it too!

<FlattopCarousel />

The shuttle leaves from the downtown bike rental shop which is walkable from Humpy's. We had to sign some waivers and our driver Peter
made sure we all had proper shoes and instructions on what to do based on difficulty level. I have to say this was the most difficult hike we did our entire trip, albeit gorgeous.
My boyfriend is afraid of heights and he mentally struggled with one particular part toward the end. I think you can do this hike even if you're afraid of heights, but as soon as it looks scary, just turn around.
The difficulty only increases. But please don't let that scare you! It's so worth it, and if you are too scared, at least do the super easy Blueberry Loop, admire the beautiful flowers, and pick some berries!

##### Anchorage to Seward
<p>
<FontAwesomeIcon icon={['fas', 'tag']} size="lg"/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time we got back downtown from Flattop, it was time to take the bus back to the airport and pick up our rental car! The Toursaver coupon book has deals on rental cars as well as the train,
but if you're planning on doing Anchorage, Seward, AND Girdwood, I think a rental car is preferrable. The drive is also beautiful as you take the scenic Seward Highway along the water almost the whole time.
</p>

##### Dinner

Once we arrived in Seward, we were hungry (a common theme), so we went to [The Cookery](https://www.cookeryseward.com/), which has great views of the water.
It was one of the more expensive restaurants we went to, but we didn't feel weird dressed casual. The food was good, but the dessert was amazing!
I rewarded myself with some Alaskan Brewing Co. Beer since I knew I would only have a limited time with my new favorite beer as it's not distributed to South Carolina :(

##### Lodging

We stayed at the [Moby Dick Hostel in Seward](http://www.mobydickhostel.com/) since we had a Kenai Fjord cruise that left from there the next day.
The hostel was great, and super close to everything. The rooms were clean and the check-in/check-out was easy.
When we arrived, the office was closed so they even left notes for us on how to check-in properly and when they would be back to take payment.
They take cash or card, but it's a bit cheaper if you use cash. They even have private rooms if you prefer.

##### A Change of Plans

<p>
<FontAwesomeIcon icon={['fas', 'tag']} size="lg"/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; When we woke up, we had planned to take <a href="https://majormarine.com/">a cruise of the Kenai Fjords National Park with Major Marine Tours,</a> complete with all you can eat salmon and prime rib!
Unfortunately, a wildfire in Denali had caused really bad air quality in Seward that day. Major Marine Tours called us letting us know they had cancelled the cruise that day.
While that news really stunk, they made the right call, and gave us the opportunity to either reschedule or receive a full refund, which we did since we were running on a tight schedule.
</p>

##### Coffee

In order to figure out what our new plans should be, we needed coffee. There was the cutest coffee shop near our hostel
called [Resurrect Art Coffee House and Gallery](https://resurrectart.com/). It was built in what looked like an old chapel and, not only was it a coffee shop,
but it was also a gallery for local artists. Not just expensive gallery stuff either. We bought some cards and stickers from the shop.
While we sipped our coffee we also met the sweetest dog named Mable Bean!

##### Seward Mural Walk

Once we were done with our coffee, we weren't ready to leave Seward because it's such a beautiful town, so we [downloaded a map to try and find all of the wonderful murals painted around town.](https://www.alaska.org/guide/seward-mural-capital-walk). They were stunning and each one has a little plaque next to it explaining
what the mural means to Seward. 

<SewardMuralCarousel />

##### Lunch

The air quality started to get pretty bad and our selves pretty hungry! We decided we'd grab a bite to eat and then figure out something to do between Seward and Girdwood (our next stop) that we could breathe during.
We got [lunch at Zudy's](https://zudyscafe.com/) which is near the water. It's a cute cafe with super fresh ingredients and unbelievable pastries. It was perfect for first lunch... or second breakfast... spoiler alert: we get more lunch later!
It was also right next to the Salmon Sisters store which we popped into to look for some gifts. I really loved their clothes! Unfortunately, I think the store is now permanently closed in that location.

##### Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center

When we asked around Seward for recommendations of what to do, many people mentioned checking out the [Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center (AWCC).](https://www.alaskawildlife.org/)
Since we missed out on seeing the wildlife in the water with the cruise, it seemed like a great alternative. We checked out of our hostel,
and took the rental car to the AWCC. The AWCC does some great work rehabilitating injured and orphaned animals. They even helped restore the
Wood Bison population in Alaska!! 

<AWCCCarousel />

Big tip: Make sure you bring binoculars with you! This was an excursion we did where they really came in handy. We saw tons of animals from moose to bears to beavers!
We wanted to make sure we saw Alaska wildlife while we were here, and while it would've been cool to see them in the actual wild, it was good to know by seeing them here, we were giving our money to a worthwhile cause.
Having said that, we did pick up some delicious reindeer hotdogs while we were there and it felt a little awkward eating them in front of the reindeer.

##### Lodging
When we were done at the AWCC, we wanted to make sure we checked in to our next hostel.
We loved staying at the [Alyeska Hostel in Girdwood](http://www.alyeskahostel.com/)! The check-in process was so easy. Just call
the number that's left for you whenever you have any questions, which we didn't have any because
the instructions and rules left for us were so thorough! There were also tons of recommendations, brochures, and trail maps there,
so we took a look to figure out our next adventure. 

##### Winner Creek Trail

<WinnerCreekCarousel />

We wanted to make sure we got a hike in that day but we were pretty tired, so we looked for an easy trail.
We decided on the Winner Creek Trail which starts at the Hotel Alyeska ski resort. It was a very pretty trail
and super easy too! We got to a section where you need to use a hand tram to cross a gorge. Unfortunatlely,
the tram was out of order, but we wanted to see the rest of the trail, so we drove to the other entrance and finished the other half of the trail.

##### Dinner

![Me at the Double Musky Inn](./aug27/double-musky.jpg)

**Now my favorite part of the day... dinner!!** All the recommendations I got were for a restaurant called the
[Double Musky Inn](https://doublemuskyinn.com/). I'm going to say this was the best meal we had the entire trip!
It was also the most "all out" we went for a meal I'd say!
