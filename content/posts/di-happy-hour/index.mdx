### Summary
The Daniel Island Happy Hour Series is a **5K series** that happens Thursday afternoons. There is a fall series and a summer series.
It takes place on nice little trail in **Daniel Island, SC.** Even though it takes place on a trail, you definitely do not need trail shoes!

### Overall
I love this 5K series. There's one in the summer and another in the fall. It's close to work and during the week so I use it as a way to shake up my short runs. It's a lot of the same people at each race so it's got a great community feel and so many encouraging runners. I was always in the last group to come in (haha I'm slow) and would even receive compliments about my form and looking strong at the finish. I never get that kind of personal encouragement at other races.

### T-Shirts/SWAG
There's no swag unless you win overall or age group but you get coasters, pint glasses, mugs, etc.

### Aid Stations
There is one aid station halfway and some water at the end of the race. You also get a free drink ticket for Dockery's after.

### Course Scenery
It's actually a really pretty trail on Daniel Island. Unfortunately, there's been some construction recently which takes away from it a bit.

### Expo Quality
No expo.

### Elevation Difficulty
Very flat course but still keeps it interesting with grass, dirt trail, and wooden boardwalk terrain.

### Parking/Access
Park right next to the start line and I've never had issues.

### Race Management
The series is managed very well. Not only do they acknowledge winners but they also reward improvement over the course of the series. I think that's so important to keep runners engaged! It's also chip timed which is great despite it being so small. The trail is also very well marked.

### Conclusion
My friends and I love this series. I would recommend it to anyone in the area who won't have to deal with traffic on a weekday. It's a great way to track improvement and get you thorugh a run with awesome encouragement from the other runners. Getting a free beer from Dockery's after is just icing on the cake.
